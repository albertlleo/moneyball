#We need to create a script-dialoge? or just with an example written we are done? Lets do easy in python
Play Wiser(?)

Define the domain(?) of the project
Define the categories (p.e on a pizza the size, ingredients...)

We need to define the specs, so for this dialogue we should need the players,
also categories for each player we define (speed, force, dribbling, definition.. as many as we want), the positions of a player (defence, center, goalkeeper...), price ranges, ...


Define the profiles (agent and who is speaking)

Profiles should be: the coach/president who is looking for new players to our system of selection, and the “front-end machine” who interacts with our client.

Do a sample dialogue that represents a simple example of the situation 

Hello
Good morning Sir, thanks to trust in our services blabla
Actually 2 of my players left so I need to find new players
Perfect, to start the search I’ll need a couple of specs so I can help you to find the perfect solution. Is this ok for you?
Sure, which ones?
This specs are the price range, the position of a player, etcetc… in this order, please. (to make it simple, if not we could do match-word or idk those techniques yes hahah)
All right, so I need a medium and a defence. The price should be xxxx in  total and we need the ones who are the fastest.
Sure, thanks for the details
